Hi, Iâ€™m Raluca â€” a data-curious, ever-learning, coffee-fueled human whoâ€™s pivoted across a few careers and collected quite the skillset along the way.

Iâ€™m currently diving deep into an MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex, where I spend my time chasing complex algorithms and trying to convince Python to cooperate. Before this, I explored the fascinating intersection of Criminology and Psychology in my BSc, where I discovered a passion for data and statistics. Even earlier, I earned a nursing degree â€” which taught me both scientific reasoning and how to keep calm under pressure (plus how to fix the occasional boo-boo).

Professionally, I work as a Digital Coordinator for a national charity focused on communication and learning. I manage and develop our SharePoint intranet, design Salesforce dashboards, optimize WordPress sites, and analyze data to help guide strategy. I'm also the unofficial IT department â€” because when tech breaks, guess who they call? ðŸ‘‹

In a past life, I managed large operational teams at a major online retailer, where I led people, hit KPIs, and solved a thousand problems a day before lunch. That hands-on leadership experience still shapes how I approach challenges today â€” with structure, empathy, and a splash of humour.

Outside of work, I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning. Whether it's through formal education, online courses, or hands-on projects, I love peeling back the layers of complexity in tech and data. One day, I hope to fully grasp the inner workings of advanced machine learning models â€” and until then, I'm loving the ride.
