In this project, I explored the financial resilience of UK charities during and after COVID-19 by segmenting them into resilience archetypes using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and DBSCAN clustering. The dataset consisted of over 200,000 financial records prepared for the UK Civil Society Almanac.

ðŸ§¹ Data Preparation
Cleaned and standardised 200k+ charity-year records, removing duplicates and parsing fiscal year dates.
Derived key features for resilience analysis:
Shock: % change in income FY19 â†’ FY20.
Bounce: % change FY20 â†’ FY21.
Reserve ratio: reserves / income.
Income diversification index: Herfindahl score across income streams.
Standardised all features with StandardScaler to ensure comparability.
