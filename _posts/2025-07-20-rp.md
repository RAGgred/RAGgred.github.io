## Unit 1
### e-Portfolio Activity: Reflective Activity 1 – Ethics in Computing in the age of Generative AI

Whilst AI is not a new technology, the rapid developments in the past years, particularly around large language models and computer vision have fundamentally reshaped the technical and ethical landscapes in computing. The rapid adaptation at scale of AI, both in day-to-day life and in the workforce has created unprecedented change and need for ethical, legal and professional norms. 

The meta-analysis introduced by Correa and colleagues (2023) has analysed a collection of 200 governance documents from 37 countries in an effort to compare the ethical guidelines across the globe. The key findings in this study involve the identification of 17 core ethical principles, such as transparency, justice, privacy and reliability that are mirrored across the field. Previously, Jobin, Ienca and Vayena (2019) and Fjeld et al. (2020) performed similar smaller-scaled studies, that reflect the findings of Correa and colleagues (2023). Whilst not directly looking at ethics, more granular studies, such as meta- analysis completed by Atf and Lewis (2025) and the meta-analysis completed by Kaplan et. al (2021) also support the idea that trust in AI is related to transparency and explainability. However, as Correa et. al (2025) argue, principles such as sustainability, labour rights, and truthfulness are 

One concerning revelation made by Correa et al. (2025) is the preference for the so-called 'soft law' solutions which are not binding or legally enforceable but rather refer to non-binding ethical principles. This is particularly concerning, as it leaves the regulation of AI practices in the hands of corporations and it’s not always clear if external oversight is applied or considered in writing the governance documents.  According to Bietti (2020) this practice can lead to the trivialization of ethics and raises concerns about lack of accountability and ethics washing.  

Tools like GPT and DALLE introduce new dimensions to the ethical problem and have opened the debate around issues such as misinformation, copywrite infringement, data privacy labour displacement, algorithmic bias and the black box issue when it comes to decision-making. A report published by Glassdoor Economic Research (2025) found that around 62% of the professionals they interviewed reported they use tools like Chat-GPT in their workplace, and little is known about how the tools are used in their day-to-day work. More alarming perhaps is the lack of internal policies concerning the use of AI. For example, only 4% of the charities surveyed by Charity Comms (Clarke, 2024) report that they have AI policies or guidelines in place. Furthermore, models such as GPT require enormous amounts of data for training, raising concerns around data privacy. These concerns are not unfounded as OpenAI was identified as having processed users’ personal data to train their model without identifying a legal basis first (Mattson, 2025).

Despite these issues, Correa and colleagues (2023) find only 2% of the documents focus on long-term ethical implications. This could prove disastrous in the eventuality of the creation of Superintelligent AI systems (ASI) .

In light of these findings, I propose that a combination of legally binding regulations with enforceable ethical standards and practical implementation tools should be implemented. 

When it comes to legal frameworks, governments should adopt mandatory regulations covering data provenance, transparency standards for AI models, as well as environmental sustainability. The EU AI Act (European Commission, 2021) offers a promising model that classifies AI systems based on risk and setting mandatory requirements accordingly.(Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL LAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION LEGISLATIVE ACTS, 2021)

Furthermore, organisations should have internal ethical review boards that should be responsible for the creation and enforcement of guidance and policies in line with the existing legal frameworks or frameworks such as the IEEE’s Ethically Aligned Design (2019). (IEEE (2019) Ethically Aligned Design: A Vision for Prioritizing Human Well-being with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, 1st ed - Google Search, no date)

There is also a need for professional toolkits and the enforcement of safeguards when developing models such as the introduction of bias detection algorithms and model interpretability tools where appropriate even if such solutions are more computationally costly. 

Furthermore, as computing professionals we are bound by codes of conduct, however, the rapid adoption of machine learning tools by more and more corporations challenges us to reinterpret those existing codes in the context where our systems may be used in warfare, influence elections or perpetuate stereotypes. This enforces the need of strong internal whistleblowing protections and professional ethics-by-design training. 

Socially, the uneven geographical representation in AI governance documents reinforces existing global power imbalances. The United States and Europe dominate the discourse, while Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia remain marginalized (Correa et al 2023; Fjeld, J. et al. 2020; Hagendorff, T. 2020). This inequity must be corrected by translating documents, funding regional ethics centres, and including diverse cultural perspectives in global AI governance (Kiemde and Kora, 2023).(Kiemde and Kora, 2022) (Fjeld et al., 2020)

Furthermore, the lack of legally enforceable standards creates a vacuum that allows ethically dubious practices to persist. When crafting laws, scholars such as Mittelstadt (2019) (Mittelstadt, 2019)argue for a “human rights-based” approach to AI governance, which offers universal protection across jurisdictions.

Correa et al. (2023) provides a sobering outlook of the future of AI governance. Their study exposes the promise and pitfalls of current global efforts to regulate AI ethics. Generative AI, as a transformative force, now demands that we move from principles to practice, from soft law to hard law, and from isolated documents to integrated, enforceable standards.

### e-Portfolio Activity: Collaborative Learning Discussion 1

Smart medical devices are increasingly used in various areas of healthcare and the area of bioethics is dominated by developer perspective on the application in clinical practice (Steerling et al., 2022). This is the case for the Medical Implant Risk Analysis case study which explores the responsibilities of computing professionals in the deployment of a medical implant system. In this case study, an independent researcher has found a fault in the device’s data transmission process which can result in delayed alerts to medical staff in the case of critical health events. However, after the independent researcher meets the technical leaders of the corporation, they conclude that the risk of this type of attack is negligeable, thus the issue remains unsolved. This leads to serious ethical issues addressed by ACM Code of Ethics (2018) and BCM Code of Ethics as follows:

| **Issue in Case Study**                            | **ACM Principle Violated**                                                   | **BCS Principle Violated**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Risk to patient safety due to delayed alerts       | 1.1 – Contribute to society and human well-being<br>1.2 – Avoid harm         | Section 1 – Public Interest: “Have due regard for public health and wellbeing”             |
| Failure to act on known software fault             | 2.5 – Give comprehensive risk evaluations<br>3.1 – Public good is central    | Section 2 – Professional Competence and Integrity                                          |
| Lack of transparency with medical institutions     | 1.3 – Be honest and trustworthy                                              | Section 2 – Be honest in professional dealings                                             |
| Management prioritizing cost over safety           | 1.2 – Avoid harm<br>3.7 – Recognize and take responsibility for errors       | Section 3 – Duty to Authority                                                              |
| Potential need for whistleblowing                  | 1.5 – Respect work of others and accept responsibility<br>3.2 – Maintain integrity | Section 3 – Report risks to appropriate authority<br>Section 4 – Duty to uphold the profession |


This case has serious legal, ethical and social implications. From a legal perspective the company would face civil liability as well as fines and criminal charges depending on how grave the negligence (FDA, 2023; European Commission, 2017). 
When it comes to the social implications, this could affect the wider healthcare tech industry, as patients rely on medical implants for life-sustaining care. If a case such as this emerges, public trust in the industry will erode (Floridi et al., 2018). 
When it comes to the ethical implications computing professionals have the ethical obligation (ACM, 2018: Principle 1.5) to escalate concerns or consult legal counsel. In life-critical scenarios, whistleblowing may be ethically justified (Johnson, 2009).

### Reflections

This unit laid the foundation for thinking about computing not just as a technical field, but as one that’s deeply involved in ethical, legal, and social contexts. Through case studies and frameworks like the ACM Code of Ethics and the BCS Code of Conduct, I came to appreciate that ethical challenges in computing are rarely black-and-white. Rather, they exist in complex grey areas, especially when working with technologies like AI that evolve faster than policy can keep up.

As a practicing data scientist, I regularly work with user behaviour data, predictive models, and occasionally sensitive demographic information. This module helped reinforce why principles like fairness, transparency, and accountability are not optional but essential. It also highlighted that ethics is not a final checkbox but a continuous commitment throughout a system’s lifecycle. I left the unit with a stronger appreciation of how codes of conduct can support, not limit, innovation by helping professionals build user trust and avoid reputational damage.

## Unit 2

### Reflections

This unit introduced the core principle that the quality of research depends on the quality of the research question. Initially, I proposed “Deep learning in epidemic modelling” as my topic. While interesting and aligned with my technical interests, the scope quickly proved to be far too broad. I realised that vague or overambitious questions can lead to unfocused literature reviews and ultimately weak proposals. Narrowing the scope is not about limiting creativity—it’s about achieving depth and rigour.

This unit taught me to consider feasibility, time constraints, and originality when refining a question. It also made me reflect on how my personal interests (especially in the third sector) might shape my academic goals. I began exploring whether my dissertation could apply to real-world challenges faced by NGOs or public health agencies. This social impact presented by epidemics helped shape my ongoing direction.

## Unit 3

### e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review

Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:
	Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?
Based on my initial project idea which revolves around building and validating a forecasting model the most appropriate research method is Quantitative Research with a descriptive research design
	Which data collection methods would you consider using?
Given that my project revolves around public health, Secondary data sources and publicly available data will be used. 
	Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?
I need to develop mathematical modelling, ethical awareness and machine learning skills. 

### Reflections
Continuing from Unit 2, this unit deepened my engagement with the available academic literature. As I began reading more deeply into the intersections of deep learning and epidemiology, it became evident just how saturated the topic already is. This encouraged me to find a more strategic approach by identifying gaps, weaknesses, or unexplored combinations in the existing research.

This unit also highlighted the importance of research as a conversation, one where I needed to find a specific voice and make a unique contribution. I learned to differentiate between foundational work and cutting-edge contributions, and how to use citation trails to trace scholarly debates. These skills significantly strengthened my ability to critique and synthesize existing research.

## Unit 4

### Literature Review Outline 

Proposed Title:
Implementing Deep Learning Tools and Techniques in Epidemic Modelling 

Research Focus:
This literature review will examine the role of deep learning (DL) methods in improving epidemic modelling. The goal is to critically assess the effectiveness of DL tools (e.g., RNNs, LSTMs, CNNs, GNNs, Transformers) in forecasting disease spread compared to traditional mechanistic models (e.g., SIR, SEIR).

Key Themes and Sections to Review:
1.	Traditional Epidemic Modelling Approaches
2.	Deep Learning in Time-Series and Spatial Modelling
3.	Hybrid Models in Literature: Case studies combining DL with epidemiological structures
5.	Ethical, Practical, and Operational Constraints: Data privacy, model transparency, high computational cost

Initial Sources to Explore:
•	Sarker (2021), Clement et al. (2021) – on deep learning in health
•	Liao et al. (2021), Jadhav et al. (2021) – hybrid model applications
•	van Hilten et al. (2024) – explainable AI in epidemiology
•	Ward et al. (2025), Thompson et al. (2022) – ethical and sustainability concerns

### Reflections
In this unit, I began to feel the shift from theory to practice. I realised that without good tools and workflows, research can quickly become overwhelming. I adopted Zotero for reference management and integrated it with Obsidian for note-taking. This seemingly minor decision had a transformative effect on my workflow. I could now annotate PDFs, tag ideas, and search across my notes with ease.

These digital tools not only improved efficiency but helped me develop a more structured understanding of the literature. I began tagging papers by method, dataset, and outcome, which later proved invaluable when writing my review. This also improved my confidence in conducting thorough and reproducible research which is a key professional expectation in data science.

### Unit 7-9 Collaborative Learning Discussion 2

The scenario involving Abi presents several ethical and professional common dilemmas in data science and related fields. Whilst the issue of falsifying data is not present in this case, selective analysis to favour the product can be seen as biased and be considered misinterpretation, with the notion that ‘statistics can support either side reflecting a misuse of statistical inference which can undermine the integrity of scientific research (Gigerenzer et al., 2004). 

This can lead to a loss of trust in nutrition research and could also potentially raise safeguarding concerns, as children and young people are most often targeted by cereal companies (Nestle, 2013).

Abi should present all relevant analyses. A data professional has the ethical duty to report findings objectively, whatever those may be. According to the BCS (2023) data professionals should present their findings with honesty and have due regard for the larger interest of the public. Given that the results may indicate that Whizzz product may be harmful Abi would be in direct contradiction with both ACM (2018) and BCS (2023), as both codes of ethics emphasise avoiding harm.

Furthermore, from a legal standpoint they will still bear indirect responsibility for the potential misuse of the analysis even if they cannot control how Wizzz will use their work. One potential remedy is for Abi to publish the results independently in a peer-reviewed environment to ensure accountability, as consumer and product liability laws could find both Abi and the company guilty in case of public health consequences (UK Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008).

### Reflections
This unit gave me a welcome return to core statistical foundations. It focused on hypothesis testing, p-values, significance, and descriptive statistics. Though familiar, the exercises reminded me of how easy it is to misuse or overinterpret statistical results—especially in fields like public health where decisions carry real consequences.

Practicing hypothesis testing allowed me to better appreciate the relationship between sample size, confidence intervals, and error margins. I found that these concepts reinforced my current work as a data scientist, where I am often expected to validate assumptions or test feature relevance. Moreover, the focus on interpretation and not just calculation was crucial for improving communication with non-technical stakeholders.

### Reflections
This was perhaps the most intensive and transformative unit. After weeks of refining my research question and reviewing literature, I proposed a hybrid deep learning model for epidemic forecasting. I wanted to avoid repeating previous studies, so I designed a new framework integrating a mechanistic SEIARN model with Transformer Networks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

The process was both exciting and daunting. I often doubted whether I could handle the technical complexity of combining such models. However, I will learn nothing if I don't challange myself. I began reviewing mathematical resources, exploring code repositories, and sketching data pipelines. It pushed me to develop new habits of planning and iterative testing.

Alongside the technical work, I completed an inference worksheet, which helped consolidate my understanding of probabilistic reasoning and gave me a breather from the conceptual intensity of the model design.

### Reflections

This unit was light but meaningful. The focus was on creating effective data visualisations. While the activities were basic (mostly Excel-based), they reminded me of the importance of clarity when presenting data. In my professional role, I’ve often seen models fail to gain traction simply because the results were not communicated clearly.

I reflected that more challenge could have come from using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn, but I also appreciated the break. The key takeaway was that even simple charts can carry a lot of power if designed well.

## Unit 10

### Reflections
This unit was meant to culminate in a research proposal presentation. Unfortunately, I experienced an unexpected personal loss. My grandfather passed away and I was unable to deliver the presentation. While disappointing, the experience served as a reminder that resilience is an essential skill in both academic and professional life.

It also prompted me to think about contingency planning and time buffering in future projects. I’ve since developed a personal protocol for managing overlapping deadlines and unexpected disruptions.

### Reflections
In this final unit, I submitted my research proposal and completed my Professional Skills Matrix. This exercise helped me realise how far I’ve come—not only in subject knowledge, but also in confidence, organisation, and ethical awareness. Creating a reflective e-Portfolio was especially meaningful, as mine directly contributed to securing my current job.

The unit reaffirmed my belief that a portfolio is not just a storage of evidence, but a narrative of growth. It’s an opportunity to showcase how academic learning translates into real-world application, and a platform for lifelong learning and career development.
